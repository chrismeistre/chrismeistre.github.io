I have 22 years experience in the IT industry, of which 18 have been as a professional software developer.

During this time I have worked on a vast number and variety of projects, ranging from small to large scale.

I am passionate about software development, and love solving problems. The more difficult the challenge, the more satisfying it is when the solution is found. I take pride in providing work that is of the highest quality.

I am currently, and have in the past, subcontracted to a number of software and web development companies. I know how to work well in a team, and can operate independently as well.

The majority of the work that I am involved with is remote, so I am able to be displined enough to stick to deadlines.

Right now I am trying to move into a role that is more focused on Cyber Security (specifically penetration testing) as this has been a passion of mine since an early age. I have recently completed my 24 hours exam to obtain my OSCP Certification, as well as the 48 hours exam to obtain my OSEP certification.
